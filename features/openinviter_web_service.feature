Feature: Open Inviter Web Service

    From a Rails application,
    I want to send a provider, username, password and get back JSON list of contacts
    So that we can send health club passes to each member

Scenario: Successfully fetch the contact list from each provider

Scenario: Bad Username / Password status is returned in JSON

Scenario: Successful Login But No Contacts Exist

Scenario: Getting OpenInviter Plugins when they are updated on the openinviter.org site

Scenario: Upgrading to new versions of OpenInviter
